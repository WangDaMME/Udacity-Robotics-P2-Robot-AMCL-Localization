# Udacity-Robotics-P2-Robot-AMCL-Localization
Robot Localization using Adaptive MCL Method

In this project, I learned to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a 2-wheel mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments. This project is carried out with several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:

  · Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world
  · Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot
  · Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results
